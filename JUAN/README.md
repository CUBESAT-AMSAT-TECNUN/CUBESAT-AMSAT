# CUBESAT-AMSAT - JUAN LACOSTA
In this Github you will find my version of the CubeSat.
All the boards were built and tested and the structure of the CubeSat is already assembled. All the instructions and material needed will be saved here. 

Mi objective is to build the CubeSat, send all the data and receive the telemetry correctly and study the maximum transmission distance.
