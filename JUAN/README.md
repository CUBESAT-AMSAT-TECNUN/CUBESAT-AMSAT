# CUBESAT-AMSAT - JUAN LACOSTA
In this Github you will find my version of the CubeSat.
All the boards were built and tested and the structure of the CubeSat is already assembled. All the instructions and material needed are saved in here. 

My objective is to build the CubeSat, capable of reading, encoding, transmitting and decoding all the data correctly and study the maximum transmission distance.
